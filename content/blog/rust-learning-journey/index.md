## Past and Present
I am a web developer with more than 14 years of experience.
My experience has been more into backend development with PHP as the primary language.

For some years I have been consuming news about Rust. The features that impressed me were.
- Memory Safety Without Garbage Collection
- Zero-Cost Abstractions
- Concurrency Without Data Races 
- Ownership and Borrowing
- Package Manager
- Powerful Type System
- Fearless Concurrency

After years of procrastinating I finally started learning Rust actively since August 2024.
My learning alternates between reading books and watching videos related to Rust.

## So far I have consumed:
- [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
- [The Rust Lang Book Video Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLai5B987bZ9CoVR-QEIN9foz4QCJ0H2Y8)
- [C++Now 2017: Niko Matsakis "Rust: Hack Without Fear!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO1z-7cuRYI)
- Udemy courses on Rust:
- - [Ultimate Rust Crash Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/ultimate-rust-crash-course/)
- - [Ultimate Rust 2: Intermediate Concepts](https://www.udemy.com/course/ultimate-rust-2/)
- - [The Complete Rust Programming Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/rust-programming-the-complete-guide/)

Honestly coming from the PHP background I found it hard to wrap my head around the concepts related to Rust.
I have to go through the resources I mentioned above multiple times in order to grasp the concepts about rust.
For example I have gone through the Rust lang Book Video Series around 4 times.
So yes my rust learning journey was a too slow as compared to how I would pick React or Angular.

## So I got hold of the basics now what next?
Once I got a hold of the concepts of Rust, the next steps was to build some real world apps.
Since my background in is PHP I have good knowledge of building REST APIs over the years.
So that is where I started.

I started looking in to libraries and frameworks I can use to develop REST APIs in Rust.
And there are a good number of options:
- Rocket
- Actix
- Axum
- and many more

I wanted to go with a single framework or library you can say to start with.
Based on my research and comment on reddit threads I chose to start with Axum.

## How I am approaching Axum?
### Understanding concepts
I am going through the documentation of Axum. Also I am going through blog posts and videos related to axum.
### Shadowing
I am going through blog posts where small projects related axum have been implemented and trying to implement the same project myself.
### Next?
Armed with the above knowledge planning to implement a CRM project (API + UI) with auth and all the bells and whistles that a typical web application needs.
### Axum Resources
- [Space Dimp Blog](https://spacedimp.com/blog/using-rust-axum-postgresql-and-tokio-to-build-a-blog/) I have implemented the blog project [here](https://github.com/nbaig-dev/spacedimp-blog).
- [Mastering Rust Web Services: From Axum to CRUD Operations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUWSy9pXgMQ)
- [Jeremy Chone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZtlD_m59sM) video courses

I will be shadowing and implementing the above course projects myself.
Also, simultaneously I will be exploring GRPC with tonic.

`I will be updating this page as and when I progress with my Rust learning.`
