Rust is used by many companies for a variety of tasks, including web development, game development, and systems programming. It’s known for its focus on creating reliable, efficient software, and for having a friendly, inclusive community.<p>Rust, a modern system programming language, is often misunderstood in several ways.<h2 id=misconception-1-rust-is-too-difficult-to-learn><a aria-label="Anchor link for: misconception-1-rust-is-too-difficult-to-learn" class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href=#misconception-1-rust-is-too-difficult-to-learn><span aria-hidden=true class=link-icon></span></a> Misconception 1: Rust is Too Difficult to Learn</h2><p>This is a common misconception about Rust. While it’s true that Rust has a steep learning curve compared to some other languages, this is largely due to its unique features like ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes, which are different from what most programmers are used to. However, these features are also what make Rust powerful and safe.<p>Rust is designed to be explicit and avoid hidden behavior, which can actually make it easier to understand once you get past the initial learning curve. The Rust community has also put a lot of effort into providing comprehensive documentation and learning resources, such as “The Rust Programming Language” book (also known as “The Book”), and “Rust by Example”.<p>Furthermore, Rust’s strong type system and helpful compiler error messages guide developers towards writing correct code. The compiler acts as a teaching tool, helping you understand Rust’s rules as you code.<p>So, while Rust can be challenging to learn, it’s not insurmountably difficult. With time and practice, most developers can become proficient in Rust.<h2 id=misconception-2-rust-is-only-for-systems-programming><a aria-label="Anchor link for: misconception-2-rust-is-only-for-systems-programming" class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href=#misconception-2-rust-is-only-for-systems-programming><span aria-hidden=true class=link-icon></span></a> Misconception 2: Rust is Only for Systems Programming</h2><p>While Rust was originally designed with systems programming in mind, it’s not limited to just that. This misconception likely arises from Rust’s focus on low-level system performance and memory safety, which is critical in systems programming.<p>However, Rust’s features make it suitable for a wide range of applications. For instance, Rust’s robust concurrency support makes it great for web programming. The Rust ecosystem has mature web frameworks like Axum and Actix, and async libraries like Tokio, making it easier to build fast and reliable web applications.<p>Additionally, Rust’s safety guarantees and C interoperability make it a good choice for embedding in other languages or writing game engines. Rust is also used in fields like data science and machine learning, with libraries like ndarray and Leaf.<p>In short, Rust is a versatile language that can be used in many areas of software development, not just systems programming.<h2 id=misconception-3-rust-s-ownership-model-is-overly-complicated><a aria-label="Anchor link for: misconception-3-rust-s-ownership-model-is-overly-complicated" class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href=#misconception-3-rust-s-ownership-model-is-overly-complicated><span aria-hidden=true class=link-icon></span></a> Misconception 3: Rust’s Ownership Model is Overly Complicated</h2><p>This is another common misconception about Rust. Rust’s ownership model is indeed different from what many programmers are used to, especially if they come from languages with garbage collection like JavaScript, Python, or Java. The concepts of ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes are unique to Rust and form the core of its memory safety guarantees.<p>However, calling it “overly complicated” might not be fair. It’s more accurate to say that it’s “unfamiliar” or “different”. Once you understand the rules and the reasons behind them, the ownership model becomes a powerful tool that helps prevent a whole class of bugs related to memory safety and data races.<p>The ownership model in Rust enforces strict borrowing and lifetime rules at compile time. This means that many issues that would be runtime errors in other languages are caught by the Rust compiler, making your code safer.<p>Moreover, the Rust compiler provides helpful error messages to guide you when you violate these rules, which makes the learning process easier.<p>So, while Rust’s ownership model does have a learning curve, it’s a fundamental part of what makes Rust unique and safe. With time and practice, it becomes second nature.<h2 id=misconception-4-rust-is-not-suitable-for-small-projects><a aria-label="Anchor link for: misconception-4-rust-is-not-suitable-for-small-projects" class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href=#misconception-4-rust-is-not-suitable-for-small-projects><span aria-hidden=true class=link-icon></span></a> Misconception 4: Rust is Not Suitable for Small Projects</h2><p>This is a misconception that stems from the belief that the benefits of Rust, such as its memory safety and concurrency features, only shine in large, complex systems. However, Rust is suitable for projects of all sizes, including small ones.<p>Rust’s package manager, Cargo, makes it easy to start small projects. It handles project creation, building, testing, and dependency management, which simplifies the development process. The standard library provides a wealth of functionality out of the box, and the vast ecosystem of libraries (known as “crates”) can be easily added to your project.<p>Moreover, even for small projects, Rust’s emphasis on safety and its helpful compiler error messages can prevent many common programming errors, leading to more robust code. Its performance characteristics can also be beneficial, even in smaller-scale applications.<p>While Rust’s strengths are indeed very beneficial in large projects, it’s also a great choice for small projects thanks to its robust tooling, safety features, and performance.<h2 id=misconception-5-rust-does-not-have-enough-libraries><a aria-label="Anchor link for: misconception-5-rust-does-not-have-enough-libraries" class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href=#misconception-5-rust-does-not-have-enough-libraries><span aria-hidden=true class=link-icon></span></a> Misconception 5: Rust Does Not Have Enough Libraries</h2><p>This misconception likely comes from comparing Rust, a relatively young language, to older, more established languages like Python or JavaScript, which have vast libraries and frameworks.<p>While it’s true that Rust’s ecosystem is not as large as those of some older languages, it’s growing rapidly and already offers a wide range of high-quality libraries (known as “crates”) for various tasks. These include web development (Axum, Actix), asynchronous programming (Tokio, async-std), serialization (serde), regular expressions (regex), and many more.<p>Rust’s package manager, Cargo, makes it easy to search for and include these libraries in your projects. The Rust community values quality and safety, so many of these libraries are well-documented and thoroughly tested.<p>Furthermore, Rust’s excellent C interoperability allows it to leverage existing C libraries, which significantly expands its range of capabilities.<p>So, while Rust’s ecosystem is still growing, it already provides a solid foundation of libraries for a wide range of tasks, and it’s getting better all the time.<h2 id=misconception-6-rust-is-too-verbose><a aria-label="Anchor link for: misconception-6-rust-is-too-verbose" class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href=#misconception-6-rust-is-too-verbose><span aria-hidden=true class=link-icon></span></a> Misconception 6: Rust is Too Verbose</h2><p>This is a misconception that arises from Rust’s explicit nature. Rust prioritizes explicitness over implicitness, which can sometimes lead to more verbose code compared to languages that make heavy use of inference or have more syntactic sugar.<p>However, this verbosity is a deliberate design choice that contributes to Rust’s readability and maintainability. By being explicit, Rust code makes it clear what it’s doing, which can help prevent bugs and make the code easier to understand for other developers.<p>Moreover, Rust does have several features to reduce verbosity where it makes sense. For example, the <code>match</code> statement and destructuring can simplify code that would be more verbose in other languages. The type inference in Rust is also quite powerful, reducing the need to annotate types in many cases.<p>So, while Rust code can be more verbose than code in some other languages, this verbosity often leads to clearer, more maintainable code. And Rust does provide features to help reduce verbosity where appropriate.<h2 id=misconception-7-rust-s-compilation-time-is-too-slow><a aria-label="Anchor link for: misconception-7-rust-s-compilation-time-is-too-slow" class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href=#misconception-7-rust-s-compilation-time-is-too-slow><span aria-hidden=true class=link-icon></span></a> Misconception 7: Rust’s Compilation Time is Too Slow</h2><p>This is a common criticism of Rust, and it’s not entirely unfounded. Rust’s compile times can be longer than some other languages. This is because the Rust compiler, <code>rustc</code>, does a lot of work to ensure memory safety, thread safety, and to perform other checks that contribute to Rust’s reliability and performance.<p>However, it’s important to note that compilation time is a trade-off. The work <code>rustc</code> does at compile time can lead to significant benefits in terms of performance and safety at runtime. Many bugs that would only be caught at runtime in other languages are caught at compile time in Rust.<p>Moreover, the Rust team is aware of this issue and has made improving compile times a priority. Incremental compilation, which recompiles only the parts of the code that have changed, is one of the features that have been introduced to address this. Tools like <code>sccache</code> can also help by caching the results of previous compilations.<p>In addition, using the <code>--release</code> flag when compiling your Rust code can increase compile times, but it also enables optimizations that can make your code run significantly faster.<p>So, while Rust’s compile times can be longer than some other languages, this is a trade-off for the benefits it provides, and there are ongoing efforts to improve it.<h2 id=misconception-8-rust-doesn-t-have-a-garbage-collector-so-memory-management-is-difficult><a aria-label="Anchor link for: misconception-8-rust-doesn-t-have-a-garbage-collector-so-memory-management-is-difficult" class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href=#misconception-8-rust-doesn-t-have-a-garbage-collector-so-memory-management-is-difficult><span aria-hidden=true class=link-icon></span></a> Misconception 8: Rust Doesn’t Have a Garbage Collector, So Memory Management is Difficult</h2><p>This is a common misconception about Rust. It’s true that Rust doesn’t have a garbage collector like languages such as Java or Python. Instead, it uses a system of ownership with a set of rules that the compiler checks at compile time. While this system is different and can be challenging to learn, it doesn’t necessarily make memory management more difficult.<p>In fact, Rust’s ownership model can make memory management more predictable and less error-prone. In garbage-collected languages, it can be hard to predict when (or if) the garbage collector will clean up memory, which can lead to performance unpredictability. In Rust, memory is deallocated as soon as the owner goes out of scope, which is deterministic and easy to reason about.<p>Moreover, Rust’s borrow checker ensures at compile time that references are always valid, which eliminates a whole class of common programming errors, such as null pointer dereferencing and dangling pointers. This can make memory management safer and easier compared to languages without these compile-time checks.<p>So, while Rust doesn’t have a garbage collector and its memory management is different from what many programmers are used to, it’s not necessarily more difficult - just different. And for many developers, it’s a difference that leads to safer, more reliable code.<h2 id=misconception-9-rust-is-not-good-for-beginners><a aria-label="Anchor link for: misconception-9-rust-is-not-good-for-beginners" class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href=#misconception-9-rust-is-not-good-for-beginners><span aria-hidden=true class=link-icon></span></a> Misconception 9: Rust is Not Good for Beginners</h2><p>This is a common misconception about Rust. It’s true that Rust has a steep learning curve due to its unique features like ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes. However, this doesn’t necessarily make it a bad choice for beginners.<p>In fact, learning Rust can be beneficial for beginners because it teaches important concepts about systems programming and memory management that are glossed over in many higher-level languages. Rust’s emphasis on explicitness and its helpful compiler error messages can also make it easier for beginners to understand what their code is doing and why it’s doing it.<p>Moreover, the Rust community is known for being friendly and welcoming, and there are many resources available for beginners, including “The Rust Programming Language” book (also known as “The Book”), and “Rust by Example”.<p>So, while Rust might be challenging for beginners, it’s not necessarily a bad choice. It can provide a solid foundation in systems programming concepts, and its safety features can help prevent beginners from developing bad habits.<h2 id=misconception-10-rust-doesn-t-have-enough-community-support><a aria-label="Anchor link for: misconception-10-rust-doesn-t-have-enough-community-support" class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href=#misconception-10-rust-doesn-t-have-enough-community-support><span aria-hidden=true class=link-icon></span></a> Misconception 10: Rust Doesn’t Have Enough Community Support</h2><p>The statement “Rust Doesn’t Have Enough Community Support” is generally considered a misconception. Here’s why:<ol><li><p><strong>Growing Community</strong>: Rust has a rapidly growing community of developers. It has been voted the “most loved language” in the Stack Overflow Developer Survey for several years in a row, indicating a strong and enthusiastic user base.</p><li><p><strong>Active Development</strong>: The Rust language and its associated tools are under active development, with regular updates and improvements. This is a sign of a healthy and vibrant community.</p><li><p><strong>Strong Ecosystem</strong>: Rust has a growing ecosystem of libraries (crates) available for use, many of which are actively maintained and improved by the community.</p><li><p><strong>Helpful Resources</strong>: There are numerous resources available for learning Rust and getting help, including the official Rust documentation, community forums, and online chat platforms.</p><li><p><strong>Corporate Backing</strong>: Rust has received support from major tech companies like Mozilla (which initiated the project), Microsoft, and Amazon AWS, further strengthening its community.</p><li><p><strong>Open Governance</strong>: Rust has an open governance model, with a core team elected by the community. This ensures that the community has a say in the direction of the language.</p></ol><p>While it’s true that Rust’s community is smaller than some other languages like JavaScript or Python, it’s also true that it’s a very active and rapidly growing one. The size of a community does not necessarily correlate with the quality of support, and many developers find the Rust community to be exceptionally helpful and welcoming.<h2 id=conclusion><a aria-label="Anchor link for: conclusion" class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href=#conclusion><span aria-hidden=true class=link-icon></span></a> Conclusion</h2><p>In conclusion, the misconception that Rust lacks community support is largely unfounded. Despite being a relatively young language, Rust has a rapidly growing, active, and enthusiastic community. The language’s focus on safety, performance, and concurrency, coupled with the community’s commitment to inclusivity and openness, has attracted a diverse group of developers.<p>Rust’s community is not just growing, but it’s also actively contributing to the language’s development and the expansion of its ecosystem. With a wealth of resources available for learning and problem-solving, as well as backing from major tech companies, Rust’s community support is robust and continually strengthening.<p>While the size of the Rust community may not yet match that of older, more established languages, it’s important to note that community support is not solely about numbers. The quality of interaction, the availability of resources, and the active development of the language and its tools all play a significant role. By these measures, Rust’s community support is thriving.<p>As Rust continues to grow and evolve, we can expect its community to do the same. Whether you’re a seasoned developer or new to programming, the Rust community is a welcoming place where you can learn, contribute, and help shape the future of the language.<p>Happy coding!</section><nav class="full-width article-navigation"><div><a href=https://nbaig-dev.github.io/blog/04-escaping-tutorial-hell-a-guide-for-aspiring-developers/>‹ Escaping Tutorial Hell - A Guide for Aspiring Developers.</a></div><div><a href=https://nbaig-dev.github.io/blog/03-understanding-rust-ownership-and-borrowing/> Understanding rust ownership and borrowing. ›</a></div></nav></article></main><div id=button-container><div id=toc-floating-container><input class=toggle id=toc-toggle type=checkbox><label class=overlay for=toc-toggle></label><label title="Toggle Table of Contents" class=button for=toc-toggle id=toc-button><svg viewbox="0 -960 960 960" xmlns=http://www.w3.org/2000/svg><path d="M414.82-193.094q-18.044 0-30.497-12.32-12.453-12.319-12.453-30.036t12.453-30.086q12.453-12.37 30.497-12.37h392.767q17.237 0 29.927 12.487 12.69 12.486 12.69 30.203 0 17.716-12.69 29.919t-29.927 12.203H414.82Zm0-244.833q-18.044 0-30.497-12.487Q371.87-462.9 371.87-480.45t12.453-29.92q12.453-12.369 30.497-12.369h392.767q17.237 0 29.927 12.511 12.69 12.512 12.69 29.845 0 17.716-12.69 30.086-12.69 12.37-29.927 12.37H414.82Zm0-245.167q-18.044 0-30.497-12.32t-12.453-30.037q0-17.716 12.453-30.086 12.453-12.369 30.497-12.369h392.767q17.237 0 29.927 12.486 12.69 12.487 12.69 30.203 0 17.717-12.69 29.92-12.69 12.203-29.927 12.203H414.82ZM189.379-156.681q-32.652 0-55.878-22.829t-23.226-55.731q0-32.549 23.15-55.647 23.151-23.097 55.95-23.097 32.799 0 55.313 23.484 22.515 23.484 22.515 56.246 0 32.212-22.861 54.893-22.861 22.681-54.963 22.681Zm0-245.167q-32.652 0-55.878-23.134-23.226-23.135-23.226-55.623 0-32.487 23.467-55.517t56.12-23.03q32.102 0 54.721 23.288 22.62 23.288 22.62 55.775 0 32.488-22.861 55.364-22.861 22.877-54.963 22.877Zm-.82-244.833q-32.224 0-55.254-23.288-23.03-23.289-23.03-55.623 0-32.333 23.271-55.364 23.272-23.03 55.495-23.03 32.224 0 55.193 23.288 22.969 23.289 22.969 55.622 0 32.334-23.21 55.364-23.21 23.031-55.434 23.031Z"/></svg></label><div class=toc-content><div class=toc-container><ul><li><a href=https://nbaig-dev.github.io/blog/06-rust-common-misconceptions/#debunking-common-misconceptions-about-rust>Debunking Common Misconceptions about Rust</a> <ul><li><a href=https://nbaig-dev.github.io/blog/06-rust-common-misconceptions/#introduction>Introduction</a><li><a href=https://nbaig-dev.github.io/blog/06-rust-common-misconceptions/#misconception-1-rust-is-too-difficult-to-learn>Misconception 1: Rust is Too Difficult to Learn</a><li><a href=https://nbaig-dev.github.io/blog/06-rust-common-misconceptions/#misconception-2-rust-is-only-for-systems-programming>Misconception 2: Rust is Only for Systems Programming</a><li><a href=https://nbaig-dev.github.io/blog/06-rust-common-misconceptions/#misconception-3-rust-s-ownership-model-is-overly-complicated>Misconception 3: Rust’s Ownership Model is Overly Complicated</a><li><a href=https://nbaig-dev.github.io/blog/06-rust-common-misconceptions/#misconception-4-rust-is-not-suitable-for-small-projects>Misconception 4: Rust is Not Suitable for Small Projects</a><li><a href=https://nbaig-dev.github.io/blog/06-rust-common-misconceptions/#misconception-5-rust-does-not-have-enough-libraries>Misconception 5: Rust Does Not Have Enough Libraries</a><li><a href=https://nbaig-dev.github.io/blog/06-rust-common-misconceptions/#misconception-6-rust-is-too-verbose>Misconception 6: Rust is Too Verbose</a><li><a href=https://nbaig-dev.github.io/blog/06-rust-common-misconceptions/#misconception-7-rust-s-compilation-time-is-too-slow>Misconception 7: Rust’s Compilation Time is Too Slow</a><li><a href=https://nbaig-dev.github.io/blog/06-rust-common-misconceptions/#misconception-8-rust-doesn-t-have-a-garbage-collector-so-memory-management-is-difficult>Misconception 8: Rust Doesn’t Have a Garbage Collector, So Memory Management is Difficult</a><li><a href=https://nbaig-dev.github.io/blog/06-rust-common-misconceptions/#misconception-9-rust-is-not-good-for-beginners>Misconception 9: Rust is Not Good for Beginners</a><li><a href=https://nbaig-dev.github.io/blog/06-rust-common-misconceptions/#misconception-10-rust-doesn-t-have-enough-community-support>Misconception 10: Rust Doesn’t Have Enough Community Support</a><li><a href=https://nbaig-dev.github.io/blog/06-rust-common-misconceptions/#conclusion>Conclusion</a></ul></ul></div></div></div><a title="Go to the top of the page" class=no-hover-padding href=# id=top-button> <svg viewbox="0 0 20 20" fill=currentColor><path d="M3.293 9.707a1 1 0 010-1.414l6-6a1 1 0 011.414 0l6 6a1 1 0 01-1.414 1.414L11 5.414V17a1 1 0 11-2 0V5.414L4.707 9.707a1 1 0 01-1.414 0z"/></svg> </a></div><span class=hidden id=copy-success> Copied!
